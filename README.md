# robot-cleaner

A cleaner-robot algorithm implementation in vanilla JS, using DFS.

## Rules

1. Robot can move forward, returning true if it succeeds, or false if it fails by hitting a wall.
2. Robot can rotate 90 degrees right.
3. Robot doesn't know the room layout, only learning from trial and error when trying to move forward.

## Goal

The Cleaner robot needs to find out a way to clean every floor tile, then return safely to it's original square.
